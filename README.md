##Description
Torchnight is a dungeon crawling turnbased roguelite ran in the browser. Users will be able to create characters that they can then run through a dungeon where they will attempt to extract whatever loot they can. Dungeons are built with modular square tiles that the player can explore one by one. Each tile could contain enemies, traps, treasure, etc... The goal is for the player to extract as much as they can without falling. Once the player makes it out, they can choose to purchase items from the shop where they can use on their next excursion. Players can manage their characters and items to prepare before making their next excursion.
